## Active Decisions
1. Work Package Management
   - Standard format established with clear sections
   - State transitions defined (DRAFT â†’ APPROVED â†’ IN_PROGRESS â†’ COMPLETED)
   - Cross-reference system implemented
   - Task tracking enhanced with detailed templates

2. Role-Based Operations
   - Planner, Implementer, Checker, Tracker roles defined
   - Clear responsibility boundaries established
   - Tool authorization matrix implemented
   - Verification protocols in place

3. Documentation Standards
   - Work package templates standardized
   - Enhanced status tracking
   - Improved version management
   - Strict cross-reference requirements

## Next Actions
1. Begin TeleportMode implementation
2. Design physics integration for teleportation
3. Implement visual feedback system
4. Create navigation mode switching UI
5. Plan comfort settings integration

## Implementation State
ðŸŸ¢ Phase 1 Complete
- Core XRPro system implemented
- Navigation framework established
- Settings system integrated
- Ready for navigation mode implementation

## Current Questions
1. Optimal physics raycast frequency?
2. Visual feedback design for each mode?
3. Controller button mapping preferences?
4. Default comfort settings values?

## Notes
The enhanced system now provides comprehensive task management through work packages, with clear state transitions and cross-referencing capabilities. The integration of work packages with the role system provides a robust framework for managing the WebXR Pro implementation tasks ahead.
