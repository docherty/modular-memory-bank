## Completed
‚úÖ Role System Implementation
- Enhanced Memory Bank system with roles (Planner, Implementer, Checker, Tracker)
- Established role-specific tool authorization
- Created comprehensive verification checklists
- Implemented role transition protocols
- Enhanced documentation workflows

‚úÖ Documentation Framework
- Created MEMORY_BANK_SYSTEM.md with complete system definition
- Created versions.md for centralized version tracking
- Established all core Memory Bank files
- Implemented documentation protocols
- Created failure recovery procedures

## In Progress
‚è≥ WebXR Pro Navigation Modes
- Preparing for TeleportMode implementation
- Planning SnapTurnMode integration
- Designing FlyMode mechanics

## Next Steps
‚úÖ Phase 1: WebXR Pro Core Implementation
- [x] Create xr-pro directory structure
- [x] Implement XRPro base system
- [x] Create NavigationMode base class
- [x] Set up Settings Manager
- [x] Implement session handling

### Phase 1: WebXR Pro Core Implementation (Using Role System)
- [ ] Create xr-pro directory structure
- [ ] Implement XRPro base system
- [ ] Create NavigationMode base class
- [ ] Set up Settings Manager
- [ ] Implement session handling

### Phase 2: Navigation Modes
- [ ] Implement TeleportMode
- [ ] Implement SnapTurnMode
- [ ] Implement FlyMode
- [ ] Create mode switching logic

### Phase 3: UI & Visualization
- [ ] Develop TeleportBeam system
- [ ] Create mode indicators
- [ ] Implement settings interface
- [ ] Add visual feedback systems

### Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] Network synchronization
- [ ] Physics system integration
- [ ] Player system coordination
- [ ] Event system hookup

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] User preference persistence

## Known Issues
None yet - implementation not started

## Questions & Decisions Needed
1. Controller mapping preferences
2. Default navigation mode
3. Comfort setting defaults
4. UI placement in VR space

## Testing Status
üî¥ Not Started
- Integration tests
- Performance tests
- VR device compatibility
- Network synchronization

## Notes
Initial planning complete, awaiting implementation start. System will be developed as a drop-in replacement for current XR functionality, focusing on VR-only support initially with standard browser fallback.
