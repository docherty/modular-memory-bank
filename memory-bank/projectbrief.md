# WebXR Pro Project Brief

## Overview
An enhanced WebXR navigation system for Hyperfy that provides advanced VR movement capabilities while maintaining the core architecture patterns.

## Core Requirements
1. Drop-in replacement for existing XR system
2. VR-only focus initially (standard browser experience as fallback)
3. Multiple navigation modes (teleport, snap turn, fly)
4. Persistent user preferences
5. High-performance physics integration
6. Seamless networking support

## Goals
- Provide best-in-class VR navigation experience
- Maintain core Hyperfy architecture patterns
- Enable easy extensibility for future modes
- Ensure smooth user experience across different VR devices

## Non-Goals
- AR support (future consideration)
- Co-existence with current XR system (replacement model)
- Mobile VR support

## Success Metrics
1. Smooth teleportation with accurate physics
2. Comfortable snap turning without disorientation
3. Intuitive flying controls
4. Consistent networking synchronization
5. Persistent user preferences across sessions
